## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the **GeoThai** npm package, please follow these guidelines to report it responsibly:

1. **Do Not Open Public Issues**: Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly, as this can put users at risk. Instead, report vulnerabilities privately.

    - A description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue.
    - Any potential impact or exploit scenarios.
    - Proof of concept or sample code, if applicable.

3. **Follow Up**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for resolution. We will work with you to understand the issue and address it as quickly as possible.

## Responsible Disclosure

To ensure a coordinated and responsible disclosure, please follow these practices:

-   **Do Not Exploit**: Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or using it in a way that could cause harm to users or systems.
-   **Private Disclosure**: Wait for us to release a fix before disclosing the vulnerability publicly.
-   **Collaborate**: Provide any additional information or assistance that may help us address the issue.

## Security Updates

-   **Patch Releases**: Security updates will be released as soon as possible. We will publish updates and advisories on our GitHub repository and notify users of critical patches.
-   **Versioning**: All security fixes will be included in patch releases. Please keep your package up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches.

## Security Practices

We take security seriously and follow best practices to protect our codebase and users:

-   **Code Reviews**: All changes to the codebase are reviewed by multiple maintainers to catch potential security issues.
-   **Automated Testing**: We use automated testing tools to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the security of our package.
